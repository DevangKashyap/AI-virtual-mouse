Project: An AI Virtual Mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI!

Exploring the basics and functions of OpenCV has been an incredible journey. The ability to harness computer vision for real-world applications is truly fascinating. Our virtual mouse can track hand movements and translate them into cursor movements on the screen, making it an innovative and practical solution for hands-free control.
